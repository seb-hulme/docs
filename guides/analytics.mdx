Track your team's performance and understand your reply patterns with Replyify's analytics dashboard.

## Overview Metrics

Your analytics dashboard shows key performance indicators:

### Total Replies

All replies received across your connected sequencers (excluding archived).

### Pending

Replies awaiting your response. Keep this number low for fast lead response times.

### Sent

Total responses you've sent through Replyify.

### Positive Rate

Percentage of replies classified as positive (Interested, Meeting Request, Question).

<Info>
A healthy positive rate for cold email campaigns is typically 3-8% of total sends.

## Speed to Lead

One of the most important metrics for cold email success. Track how quickly you're responding to interested leads.

### Auto Reply Speed

Average time between receiving a reply and AI sending an automated response (when using Auto-Send mode).

**Benchmark:** Under 5 minutes is excellent.

### Manual Reply Speed

Average time between receiving a reply and you manually sending a response (drafts reviewed and sent).

**Benchmark:** Under 2 hours during business hours.

### Overall Reply Speed

Combined average across all response methods.

<Tip>
Studies show responding within 5 minutes increases conversion rates by up to 21x compared to responding after 30 minutes.

## Reply Categories

See the distribution of your replies by category:

| Category | What it means |
|----------|--------------|
| Interested | High intent - prioritize these |
| Meeting Request | Very high intent - book immediately |
| Question | Engaged but needs info |
| Not Interested | Polite pass |
| Out of Office | Temporary unavailable |
| Unsubscribe | Remove from lists |
| Bounce | Invalid email |

### Category Insights

Use category distribution to:

- **Optimize targeting**: High bounce rates suggest list quality issues
- **Improve copy**: High "Not Interested" rates may indicate messaging problems
- **Measure success**: Track positive rate over time

## Using Analytics

### Identify Bottlenecks

<Steps>
  <Step title="Check pending count">
    High pending count = replies not being addressed quickly
  </Step>
  <Step title="Review manual reply speed">
    Slow speed = team may need more resources or better processes
  </Step>
  <Step title="Analyze category distribution">
    Unexpected patterns may indicate targeting or messaging issues
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Optimize Campaigns

Use analytics to improve your cold email campaigns:

1. **A/B test messaging**: Track positive rates across different campaigns
2. **Clean your lists**: Monitor bounce rates to improve deliverability
3. **Refine targeting**: High "Not Interested" suggests targeting issues
