## Webhook Issues

### Webhook Not Receiving Replies

If replies aren't appearing in your inbox:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Verify the webhook URL">
    Make sure you copied the **full** webhook URL from Replyify, including the connection ID at the end.

    Correct format:
    ```
    https://app.replyify.ai/api/webhooks/instantly/abc123-def456
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Check webhook configuration">
    In your sequencer, ensure:
    - The webhook is enabled/active
    - "Reply" events are selected
    - The URL is saved correctly
  </Step>
  <Step title="Confirm connection is active">
    In Replyify, check that the connection isn't paused:
    - Go to **Connections**
    - Verify status shows "Active"
  </Step>
  <Step title="Test with a real reply">
    Send a campaign and reply to it yourself. Wait 1-2 minutes for the webhook to process.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### "Connection Not Found" Errors

This means the connection ID in the webhook URL doesn't match any active connection:

1. Go to **Connections** in Replyify
2. Click on your connection
3. Copy the webhook URL again
4. Update it in your sequencer

<Warning>
If you deleted and recreated a connection, the webhook URL changes. Update your sequencer with the new URL.
</Warning>

## AI Response Issues

### AI Not Generating Responses

If you're not seeing AI-generated drafts:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Check your AI reply limit">
    Go to **Billing** and verify you haven't reached your monthly limit.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Verify AI mode is enabled">
    In **Clients**, check that the client has AI reply mode set to "Draft" or "Auto-Send" (not "Off").
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Check reply category">
    AI only generates responses for positive categories (Interested, Meeting Request, Question). OOO, bounces, and "Not Interested" don't trigger AI.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Verify service description exists">
    AI needs context to generate responses. Ensure your client has a service description configured.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### AI Responses Are Low Quality

Improve AI response quality:

1. **Add more context to service description**: Include value propositions, target audience, and typical outcomes
2. **Configure a calendar link**: If you want AI to include booking options
3. **Review and correct categories**: AI learns from your corrections

## Category Classification Issues

### Replies Being Misclassified

If replies are in the wrong category:

1. **Manually correct**: Open the reply and change the category
2. **AI learns**: Your corrections improve future classifications
3. **Ambiguous replies**: Very short or unclear replies may need manual classification

### Categories Not Showing

If category options are missing:

1. Go to **Settings → Categories**
2. Verify categories exist and are active
3. Custom categories may need to be created first

## Connection Issues

### "Invalid API Key" Error

Your sequencer API key may be incorrect or expired:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Get a new API key">
    Log into your sequencer (Instantly, EmailBison) and generate a new API key.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Update the connection">
    In Replyify, edit the connection and paste the new API key.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Save and test">
    Save the changes and send a test reply to verify.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Connection Shows "Last Event: Never"

The connection was created but hasn't received any webhooks:

1. Verify webhook URL is configured in your sequencer
2. Ensure you're sending campaigns that could receive replies
3. Check that webhook events include "Reply" type
4. Send a test and reply to it yourself

## Account Issues

### Can't Access Billing

Only workspace **Admins** and **Owners** can access billing:

1. Check your role in **Settings → Team**
2. Contact your workspace admin if you need billing access
3. Request a role change if appropriate

### Can't Invite Team Members

Team invitations require Admin or Owner role:

1. Verify your role is Admin or Owner
2. Members cannot invite new team members
3. Contact your admin to send invitations

### Invitation Link Expired

Invitation links expire after 7 days:

1. Go to **Settings → Team**
2. Find the pending invitation
3. Click **Resend** to send a new invitation

## Performance Issues

### Inbox Loading Slowly

Try these optimizations:

1. **Apply filters**: Reduce the number of visible replies
2. **Archive old replies**: Clear out processed items
3. **Check your browser**: Use Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or Edge
4. **Clear browser cache**: Refresh with Ctrl+Shift+R (Cmd+Shift+R on Mac)

### Replies Not Appearing Immediately

Webhooks typically process within seconds, but may take up to 2 minutes:

1. Wait 2 minutes after the reply is sent
2. Refresh your inbox manually
3. Check **Connections** for "Last Event" timestamp
4. Verify the webhook is configured correctly
