## Best Practices

### Role Assignment

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="When to use Admin role">
    - Team leads who need to manage members
    - Account managers who configure clients
    - Senior staff who need full access
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="When to use Member role">
    - Team members focused on responding to leads
    - New hires during onboarding
    - Contractors with limited access needs
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Security Tips

1. **Regular audits**: Review team members quarterly
2. **Role minimization**: Give the least access needed
3. **Remove promptly**: Remove members who leave immediately
4. **Owner backup**: Consider having a trusted Admin who could take over

## Multiple Workspaces

Team members can belong to multiple workspaces:

- Each workspace has separate settings and data
- Switch between workspaces using the workspace selector
- Roles are workspace-specific (Admin in one, Member in another)

<Tip>
Agencies often create separate workspaces per major client to keep data and teams organized.
