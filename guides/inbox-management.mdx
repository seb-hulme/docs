Your inbox is the central hub where all replies from your connected email sequencers appear. Each reply is automatically processed and classified by our AI.

## Understanding Your Inbox

### Reply Categories

All incoming replies are automatically classified into categories:

| Category | Description | AI Response |
|----------|-------------|-------------|
| **Interested** | Leads showing buying intent | Yes |
| **Meeting Request** | Leads wanting to schedule a call | Yes |
| **Question** | Leads asking for more information | Yes |
| **Not Interested** | Polite declines | No |
| **Out of Office** | Auto-replies and OOO messages | No |
| **Unsubscribe** | Opt-out requests | No |
| **Bounce** | Undeliverable emails | No |

<Info>
AI only generates draft responses for **positive** categories (Interested, Meeting Request, Question). This ensures your AI reply credits are used efficiently.

### Reply Status

Each reply has a status that tracks where it is in your workflow:

- **Pending** - New replies awaiting action
- **Ready** - Replies with AI-generated drafts ready to send
- **Sent** - Replies you've responded to
- **Archived** - Replies you've dealt with and hidden from view
