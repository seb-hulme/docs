## Understanding AI Replies

### What Counts as an AI Reply?

AI replies only count when our AI generates a response for positive leads:

**Counts toward limit:**
- Interested leads
- Meeting requests
- Questions requiring follow-up

**Does NOT count (unlimited):**
- Out of Office replies
- Bounce notifications
- Not Interested responses
- Unsubscribe requests

<Info>
This ensures your AI reply credits are used efficiently on high-value leads that actually need responses.
</Info>

### Monitoring Usage

Track your usage in **Billing**:

- Current month's AI replies used
- Total limit for your plan
- Usage percentage bar
- Days until reset
