Replyify uses advanced AI to automatically generate personalized responses for your positive leads, saving you time while maintaining a human touch.

## How AI Responses Work

When a positive or interested reply comes in, our AI automatically generates a personalized response based on:

- **Original Message**: The content of the lead's reply
- **Client Context**: Your client's service description
- **Calendar Link**: Your booking link (if configured)
- **Lead Information**: The lead's name and conversation context
- **Thread History**: Previous messages in the conversation

<Info>
AI responses appear as **drafts** that you can review, edit, and send. You maintain full control over what gets sent.
</Info>

## AI Reply Modes

Configure how AI handles responses for each client in their settings:

### Draft Mode (Recommended)

AI creates draft responses for you to review before sending.

**Best for:**
- High-value leads requiring personalization
- Complex products or services
- Agencies managing client communications
- Teams new to AI-assisted responses

### Auto-Send Mode

AI automatically sends responses without manual review.

**Best for:**
- High-volume campaigns
- Simple, standardized responses
- Well-tested AI configurations
- Time-sensitive follow-ups

<Warning>
Use Auto-Send Mode carefully. Ensure your client's service description and calendar link are accurate before enabling.
</Warning>

### Off

Disable AI responses entirely. Replies still get categorized, but no drafts are generated.

**Best for:**
- Clients who prefer fully manual responses
- Testing new connections
- Categories that don't need AI (OOO, bounces, etc.)

## Editing AI Responses

### Using the Rich Text Editor

Click on any reply to open the detail panel with the AI-generated draft:

1. Review the generated response
2. Click into the editor to make changes
3. Use formatting tools for bold, italic, links, etc.
4. Click **Send** when ready

### Common Edits

- **Personalization**: Add specific details about the lead's company or needs
- **Tone Adjustment**: Match your client's voice
- **Additional Information**: Include relevant case studies or links
- **Calendar Updates**: Change or add meeting options

## Improving AI Quality

### Optimize Your Client Settings

The AI uses your client configuration to generate better responses:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Write a detailed service description">
    Include what your client offers, their unique value proposition, and target market. More context = better responses.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add a calendar booking link">
    If you want AI to include meeting scheduling, add the booking link. AI will naturally integrate it into responses.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Review and correct classifications">
    When you change a misclassified reply's category, the AI learns from your corrections.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Example Service Description

A good service description provides context for AI:

<CodeGroup>
```text Good Example
We help B2B SaaS companies increase their demo bookings by 40%
through automated cold email campaigns. Our done-for-you service
includes list building, copywriting, and campaign management.
Typical clients are Series A-C startups looking to scale outbound.
```

```text Bad Example
We do email marketing.
```
</CodeGroup>

## AI Reply Credits

Your plan includes a set number of AI replies per month:

| Plan | AI Replies/Month |
|------|------------------|
| Starter | 200 |
| Growth | 600 |
| Scale | 1,500 |

### What Counts as an AI Reply?

**Counts toward limit:**
- AI-generated responses for positive/interested leads
- Meeting request responses
- Question responses

**Does NOT count:**
- Out of Office replies
- Bounce notifications
- Not Interested classifications
- Unsubscribe requests

<Tip>
AI only generates responses for categories that typically need follow-up, so your credits are used efficiently on high-value leads.
</Tip>

### Reaching Your Limit

When you hit your monthly limit:

1. AI stops generating new draft responses
2. You can still view and manually respond to all replies
3. Existing drafts remain available to send
4. Your limit resets at the start of your next billing cycle

Consider upgrading your plan if you consistently hit your limit.
