## Managing Connections

### Viewing Connection Details

Click on any connection to see:

- **Status**: Active or paused
- **Last Event**: When the last reply was received
- **Webhook URL**: The URL to configure in your sequencer
- **API Key**: Masked view of your credentials

### Pausing Connections

You can pause a connection temporarily without deleting it:

1. Open the connection details
2. Click **Pause Connection**
3. The connection turns inactive

**When to pause:**
- Troubleshooting webhook issues
- Temporarily stopping processing for an account
- Testing a new configuration

<Info>
Paused connections won't process incoming webhooks. Replies sent to paused connections are ignored.
</Info>

### Deleting Connections

<Warning>
Deleting a connection is permanent. All associated data remains, but the webhook URL will stop working.
</Warning>

To delete a connection:
1. Open the connection details
2. Click **Delete Connection**
3. Confirm the deletion

## Webhook Configuration

### Webhook URL Format

Each connection has a unique webhook URL:

```
https://app.replyify.ai/api/webhooks/{platform}/{connectionId}
```

<Tip>
Always copy the full URL including the connection ID. The ID is required to route replies to the correct connection.
</Tip>

### Webhook Events

Configure your sequencer to send these events:

| Event | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| Reply Received | Yes | When someone replies to your email |
| Email Opened | Optional | Track open rates |
| Link Clicked | Optional | Track engagement |

<Note>
While Replyify can receive open and click events, the primary functionality focuses on **Reply Received** events.
</Note>

### Testing Webhooks

After setting up a connection:

1. Send a test campaign from your sequencer
2. Reply to the test email
3. Check Replyify inbox for the reply
4. Verify the connection shows "Last Event" updated

## Multiple Connections

You can connect multiple accounts and platforms:

**Use cases:**
- Different sequencers for different clients
- Multiple Instantly accounts for scale
- Consolidating replies from various tools

<Tip>
Each connection has its own webhook URL, so you can route replies from different accounts to appropriate clients.
</Tip>

## Troubleshooting

### Connection Not Receiving Replies

1. **Verify webhook URL**: Ensure the full URL is copied correctly
2. **Check webhook configuration**: Confirm "Reply" events are selected
3. **Test manually**: Reply to a campaign email and wait 1-2 minutes
4. **Check connection status**: Ensure the connection isn't paused

### "Invalid API Key" Error

1. Regenerate your API key in the sequencer
2. Update the connection in Replyify with the new key
3. Save and test again
