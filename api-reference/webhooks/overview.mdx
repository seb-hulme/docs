Webhooks allow you to receive real-time notifications when events occur in Replyify. Instead of polling the API, you can subscribe to events and have them pushed to your server.

## How Webhooks Work

1. **Configure**: Add a webhook URL in **Settings → Webhooks**
2. **Subscribe**: Select which events you want to receive
3. **Receive**: Replyify sends HTTP POST requests to your URL when events occur
4. **Process**: Your server processes the event and responds with 2xx status

## Setting Up Webhooks

<Steps>
  <Step title="Go to Webhook Settings">
    Navigate to **Settings → Webhooks** in your dashboard.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add a webhook">
    Click **Add Webhook** and configure:
    - **Name**: A descriptive name (e.g., "CRM Integration")
    - **URL**: Your HTTPS endpoint that will receive events
    - **Events**: Select which events to subscribe to
  </Step>
  <Step title="Copy the secret">
    Save the webhook secret for verifying signatures (see [Security](/api-reference/webhooks/security)).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Test the webhook">
    Click **Send Test** to verify your endpoint is receiving events correctly.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Webhook Payload

All webhook events are sent as HTTP POST requests with a JSON body:

```json
{
  "event": "reply.received",
  "timestamp": "2024-01-15T14:30:00Z",
  "workspace_id": "ws-abc123",
  "data": {
    // Event-specific data
  }
}
```

### Headers

| Header | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `Content-Type` | `application/json` |
| `X-Replyify-Signature` | HMAC-SHA256 signature for verification |
| `X-Replyify-Event` | Event type (e.g., `reply.received`) |
| `X-Replyify-Delivery-ID` | Unique delivery ID for deduplication |

## Responding to Webhooks

Your endpoint should:

1. **Respond quickly**: Return a 2xx status within 30 seconds
2. **Process asynchronously**: Queue heavy processing for later
3. **Handle duplicates**: Use delivery ID for deduplication
4. **Return appropriate status**:
   - `200-299`: Success, delivery complete
   - `4xx`: Client error, no retry
   - `5xx`: Server error, will retry

## Retry Policy

If your endpoint returns a non-2xx status or times out:

| Attempt | Delay |
|---------|-------|
| 1 | Immediate |
| 2 | 1 minute |
| 3 | 5 minutes |
| 4 | 30 minutes |
| 5 | 2 hours |

After 5 failed attempts, the delivery is marked as failed and logged.

## Example Endpoint

<CodeGroup>
```javascript Express.js
const express = require('express');
const crypto = require('crypto');

const app = express();
app.use(express.json());

app.post('/webhooks/replyify', (req, res) => {
  // Verify signature (see Security docs)
  const signature = req.headers['x-replyify-signature'];
  const payload = JSON.stringify(req.body);
  const expectedSig = crypto
    .createHmac('sha256', process.env.WEBHOOK_SECRET)
    .update(payload)
    .digest('hex');

  if (signature !== `sha256=${expectedSig}`) {
    return res.status(401).send('Invalid signature');
  }

  // Process the event
  const { event, data } = req.body;

  switch (event) {
    case 'reply.received':
      console.log('New reply:', data.reply_id);
      // Queue for processing
      break;
    case 'reply.sent':
      console.log('Reply sent:', data.reply_id);
      break;
  }

  // Respond immediately
  res.status(200).send('OK');
});

app.listen(3000);
```

```python Flask
from flask import Flask, request, abort
import hmac
import hashlib
import os

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/webhooks/replyify', methods=['POST'])
def handle_webhook():
    # Verify signature
    signature = request.headers.get('X-Replyify-Signature')
    payload = request.get_data()
    expected_sig = 'sha256=' + hmac.new(
        os.environ['WEBHOOK_SECRET'].encode(),
        payload,
        hashlib.sha256
    ).hexdigest()

    if not hmac.compare_digest(signature, expected_sig):
        abort(401)

    # Process the event
    data = request.get_json()
    event = data['event']

    if event == 'reply.received':
        print(f"New reply: {data['data']['reply_id']}")
    elif event == 'reply.sent':
        print(f"Reply sent: {data['data']['reply_id']}")

    return 'OK', 200
```

## Managing Webhooks

### Viewing Deliveries

In **Settings → Webhooks**, click on a webhook to see:

- Recent delivery attempts
- Success/failure status
- Response codes
- Payload data

### Pausing Webhooks

Temporarily pause a webhook without deleting it:

1. Open the webhook settings
2. Toggle **Active** to off
3. Events won't be sent until re-enabled

### Deleting Webhooks

To delete a webhook:

1. Open the webhook settings
2. Click **Delete**
3. Confirm the deletion

<Warning>
Deleting a webhook immediately stops all event deliveries. Any pending retries are cancelled.
</Warning>
