## Subscribing to Events

When creating or editing a webhook, select which events to receive:

1. Go to **Settings → Webhooks**
2. Create or edit a webhook
3. Check the events you want to receive
4. Save the webhook

<Tip>
Subscribe only to events you need. This reduces unnecessary traffic and processing on your server.
</Tip>

## Event Ordering

Events are delivered in the order they occur, but delivery is **not guaranteed to be in order**. Use the `timestamp` field to establish event sequence.

<Warning>
Events may be delivered out of order due to network conditions or retries. Design your system to handle this.
</Warning>

## Idempotency

Each webhook delivery includes a unique `X-Replyify-Delivery-ID` header. Use this to detect and handle duplicate deliveries:

```javascript
const deliveryId = req.headers['x-replyify-delivery-id'];

// Check if already processed
if (await isProcessed(deliveryId)) {
  return res.status(200).send('Already processed');
}

// Process and mark as handled
await processEvent(req.body);
await markProcessed(deliveryId);

res.status(200).send('OK');
```
